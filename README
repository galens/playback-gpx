This is a script forked from: https://gist.github.com/JesseCrocker/8407623

This script replays a gpx file and outputs to geanyshell

Example usage:
python playback-gpx.py -i 1 -r "-r 192.168.56.101" "docs/South On Topanga(1).gpx"

added returnDefaultPath function so the script is more os independent
added -r option so users can pass extra flags to geanyshell like an ip address
added ability to pause execution of script with keyboard interrupt
